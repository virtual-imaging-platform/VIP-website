VIP: a platform for medical image simulation and data sharing </h1>

<p>
<b>A web platform to facilitate data sharing and access to computing resources for medical image simulation.</b> Medical images can be simulated from digital models of the human body for a variety of applications in research and industry, including fast prototyping of new devices and the evaluation of image analysis algorithms. Several image modalities are commonly simulated,  among which magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, positron emission tomography, and computed tomography.  However, image simulation remains mastered only by a few, due to the variety, complexity and heaviness of simulation pipelines. Simulation codes and physical object models are complex and specific to the imaging modality. In addition, computing times limit the realism and size of simulation scenes, Distributed computing infrastructures are available but they often remain an additional technical constraint for simulation users. The VIP project developed a web platform to facilitate the access to multi-physics organ models, to simulators, and to computing and storage resources needed for medical image simulation.

<p>
<b>Exploiting semantic information and enabling reliable execution of simulations on distributed computing platforms.</b> The VIP platform relies (i) on a semantic description of models, simulation processes and data, and on associated tools facilitating their sharing and reusability, and (ii) on a simulation execution service that can access multiple computing platforms. Concepts involved in object models, simulation processes and data were modelled in ontology OntoVIP. We also exploit web semantic tools to describe processes, compose them in workflows, capture provenance information and reason on the resulting knowledge base. The simulation execution platform consists of a task manager on local servers, clusters and grids, a data storage system, and a web portal. Simulators are integrated as workflows, which facilitates their parallelisation and their exploitation by semantic tools. Self-healing strategies have been developed to improve the quality of service provided by the platform.
</p>

<p>
<b>VIP is now used by more than 360 users from 40 countries to execute simulations.</b> According to statistics published by the European Grid Infrastructure, the VIP portal is one of the most used to access this infrastructure. Thanks to the exploitation of semantic information, multi-modality models can be shared and used in simulations. A repository also stores semantically annotated simulated data. Four applications contributed to the evaluation of the platform: the evaluation of CT simulator SINDBAD, the design of a new ultrasonic sequence, the design of models of the inflamed brain and artery, and the simulation of cardiac images for segmentation evaluation. The platform is extensible and reusable in other initiatives.

<p>
The project produced 3 articles in international journals describing the general architecture of the platform (TMI 2013), methods to assist users with workflow design (JGC 2013, still under review), and self-healing methods (FGCS 2013). Sixteen articles were also published in peer-reviewed international conferences, about semantic modeling and tools, exploitation of distributed computing resources, and applications. Six software contributions have been producedÂ : the OntoVIP ontology, modules of the Neusemstore semantic store, the Cowork workflow designer, modules of the GASW task manager, the glite data management library and the VIP portal.

VIP was an industrial research project coordinated by the <a href="http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr">CREATIS</a> laboratory. Other partners are the university of <a href="http://www.i3s.unice.fr">Nice Sophia-Antipolis</a>, <a href="https://medicis.univ-rennes1.fr/">LTSI</a>, <a href="https://www.irisa.fr/visages/">INRIA Rennes</a>, <a href="http://www-leti.cea.fr/">CEA-Leti</a> and <a href="https://gnubila.fr/">Maat-France</a>. The project started in January 2010 and lasted 37 months. It received a 975-keuro grant from ANR for a total cost of 2.8Meuros.
