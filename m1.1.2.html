<h1>Ontology in OWL / OntoSpec (M1.1.2)</h1>
<p>This is the first release of the ontology in the <a href="files/vip-model.zip">OWL format</a>. We also added the <a href="files/VIP-ModelV3.2.pdf">OntoSpec</a> file which describes the concepts in a semi-formal representation.</p>
<p><br />
The ontology is, for the moment, focused on the modelization of the simulation models. It is broken down into several OWL files, the main file to open is vip-model.owl. It is based on the DOLCE foundational ontology, and on the NeurLOG ontologies. The more convenient way to browse the ontology is to use the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; editor : http://protege.stanford.edu/ (v4.*)</p>
<p>This version contains :</p>
<ul>
    <li>the description of the models according to different semantic axes</li>
    <li>the description of the content of the model (layer/layer-part/objects)</li>
    <li>the description of the physical parameters</li>
    <li>the anatomical objects extracted from the FMA according to the list of terms identified from the models and the physical parameters</li>
    <li>the foreign-body / radiopharmaceutical / contrast agent extracted from the RadLex terminology.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next important steps are :</p>
<ul>
    <li>identify the relation with the IAMF format</li>
    <li>feed the model with pathological / pathology (need reflexion : diseases, pathology, pathological object)</li>
    <li>develop the next ontologies (simulator, simulated data)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ontology evolves constantly according to your frequent meeting, discussion and choice. The version is consequently subject to change. Do not hesitate to give us feedback or if you experience trouble trying to open it.</p>
