<h1><strong>VIP&nbsp;milestone M2.3.1 - user interface to execution environment</strong></h1>
<p>A web portal has been developed to provide an interface to the execution environment for image simulation.</p>
<p>This portal is available at http://vip.creatis.insa-lyon.fr</p>
<p>For now anonymous users can only see the front page. Users have to request a grid certificate and register to the biomed VO&nbsp;to get access to the simulators.</p>
<p>The portal is currently at release 0.3.3. The development roadmap, including new features planned until the end of the project, software releases and SVN&nbsp;repository is available at http://vip.creatis.insa-lyon.fr:9002/projects/platform/roadmap</p>
